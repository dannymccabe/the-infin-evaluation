            It’s hard to evaluate individual contributions in a team environment
            because some employees are more visible. Similarly, some employees
            may take more credit than others. Meanwhile, the ones who are
            actually driving the company’s success may be flying completely
            under the radar. And then, employers have to decide on bonuses and
            promotions based on limited information and often with resentment
            from the employees. It’s frustrating.
